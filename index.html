      <h2>Every year in the UK, 1.9 million tonnes of food is wasted. We need to waste less.</h2>
      <p></p>
But some food waste in inevitable. Tea bags, vegetable peelings etc need to go somewhere. So what can we do to limit the impact our rubbish is having?
      <p></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Think about the packaging of your food. Can you buy fruit and veg loose instead of wrapped in plastic?</li>
        <li>Keep track of what's in your fridge! Around 1m tonnes of food is binned whole or in unopened packaging, usually because it's gone past its sell-by date.</li>
        <li>For things you do need to throw away, use a food waste bin rather than throwing everything in landfill together.</li>
      </ol>
